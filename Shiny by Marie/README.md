Here for information:  
- you put all your trajectory data in the folder "data"  
- you also put all your metadata in the folder "metadata"  
These 2 folders are read by the Shiny App.   
For now, there are Guilherme and Sophie dataset inside.  

The folder "metadata guilherme"/"data guilherme" and 
"metadata sophie"/"data sophie" are here if you want to read just 1 of the 2 
dataset. In that case you need to delete the data in "data" and "metadata" 
and copy the group you want inside.
