I have cut the data and results as I don't want it to be leaked (even if it's just 2 birds).
You won't be able to have the same result with the github data.

If you find the data interesting, you can ask Sophie Bertrand for a collaboration.

If you have any questions don't hesitate to contact me,   
Best,
