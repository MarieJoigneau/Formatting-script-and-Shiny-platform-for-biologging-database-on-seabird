Here all the necessary files/folders to format a trajectory file:

 - You will find the 2 R files "Functions_by_Marie" and "Main_by_Marie".

- The csv "metadata_colony_format" and "parameters - already_chosen" are 
necessary to use the R code.

- The csv "how to name data" and "parameters - how to choose it" are here to 
help you

- When you format files, put the metadata in "metadata to format".

- And put the files in "files to format" in "folders to format". You can put
several folders in the mother folder "folders to format" but usually I only
put one type of files in the "files to format". It is already a huge and long
task for the computer

You can have more information in my report and guide "JOIGNEAU Marie - Report"
